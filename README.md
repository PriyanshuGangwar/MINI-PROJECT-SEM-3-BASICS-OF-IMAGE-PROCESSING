# MINI-PROJECT-SEM-3-BASICS-OF-IMAGE-PROCESSING
BASICS OF IMAGE PROCESSING USING C

IN THIS MINI PROJECT I HAVE DONE TWO IMAGE OPERATONS USING C LANGUAGE
1. FILTERS
   (i)  Average Filter
   (ii) Median Filter
   
2. Edge Detection

read.c file is for reading and writing the RGB BMP image in ar array.
greay.c file is for reading GREYSCALE BMP imgae.

Filter_color.c is the implementation of AVERAGE and MEDIAN filter for coloured RGB BMP IMAGE.
Filter_grey.c is the implementation of AVERAGE and MEDIAN filter for GREYSCALE BMP IMAGE.

edge.c is for detecting edge of greyscale bmp image.
